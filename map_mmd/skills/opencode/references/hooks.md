# map.mmd reference: commit hook and native CLAUDE.md integration

Load this when the user asked to install the post-commit hook or wire map.mmd into a project's CLAUDE.md.

## For git commit hook

Install a post-commit hook that auto-rebuilds the graph after every commit. No background process needed - triggers once per commit, works with any editor.

```bash
map.mmd hook install    # install
map.mmd hook uninstall  # remove
map.mmd hook status     # check
```

After every `git commit`, the hook detects which code files changed (via `git diff HEAD~1`), re-runs AST extraction on those files, and rebuilds `graph.json` and `GRAPH_REPORT.md`. Doc/image changes are ignored by the hook - run `/map.mmd --update` manually for those.

If a post-commit hook already exists, map.mmd appends to it rather than replacing it.

## For native CLAUDE.md integration

Run once per project to make map.mmd always-on in Claude Code sessions:

```bash
map.mmd claude install
```

This writes a `## map.mmd` section to the local `CLAUDE.md` that instructs Claude to check the graph before answering codebase questions and rebuild it after code changes. No manual `/map.mmd` needed in future sessions.

```bash
map.mmd claude uninstall  # remove the section
```
